This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed issue where NAMESPACE wasn't working
* Omitted the redundant "the R user with" text from the description
* Explained all acronyms in the description text
* Added link to webservice mentioned in the description text in angle brackets
* Updated declaration of license to "License: MIT + file LICENSE", and reduced the license file to YEAR and COPYRIGHT HOLDER.

* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
